# Homework-3

Problem 1:
This problem asked to use an array to create a heap with arbitrary number of children and then perform functions with it such as deleting the max number and sorting the array. Along with that we had to find out the time complexity of specific functions.

Problem 2:
This problem asked us to use a linked list to create a binary search tree and perform different functions for it. We had to search for nodes and also sort an array inside the binary tree. With the functions we also had to analyze the time and space complexity of each of the balancing algorithms.
